                <h2>Who is Evan Mackey?</h2>
                <p> 
                    Evan Mackey is a trombonist living and operating out of Los Angeles, California. Having been born and raised within the bounds of Los Angeles county gave Evan 
                    saw the entertainment industry through a unique lens. During his middle school school years Evan was given the option to select an elective course, he chose to enroll 
                    in band. When he got home that night his father went into the attic above the garage and recovered an instrument left to him by his father. It was a trombone older then 
                    the 
                    last world war. After making silly noises all night Evan decided to take the instrument to school to use in his band class. Evan quickly learned how much enjoyed 
                    the instrument and took to learning all the skills he could even taking lessons from his classroom instructor, Tom Whaley.

                <h2>The College Years</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing high school in 2000 Evan attended California State University, Northridge 
                    to pursue a career as a professional musician. While at CSU, Northridge he studied all elements of music; theory 
                    
                    (including but not limited to the compositional styles of 18th century European composers), education, writing, arranging, 
                    and the pedagogy and literature of the trombone. After two and a half years in the classical program at CSU, Northridge, Evan transferred to 
                    the jazz department to finish his degree and earn a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies. During his time in the classical department at CSU, Northridge 
                    Evan studied privately with Bill Booth working on new breathing techniques, warm-up exercises, scales, learning the art of slur on trombone, and some of the literature 
                    written for the trombone. After transferring to the jazz department Evan began studying with Alex Iles. Alex worked with Evan on transcription of solos to 
                    expand his jazz vocabulary, scales, and some of the jazz standards that are still performed to this day.
                    The teachers at CSU, Northridge encouraged students to work in the field while pursuing their Bachelor degrees.

                <h2>Trombonist at Large</h2>
                <p>
                    Heeding the advice of his teachers Evan ventured out into the world seeking work, and work he found. Besides the regular work of young brass players, performing 
                    at churches for religious ceremonies with brass ensembles and small orchestras, Evan found work doing various recording sessions. In 2003 Evan joined with the band of
                    blues artist and former member of The Sons of Adam, Jac Ttanna. As a member of Jac's band he performed at venues throughout Southern California. As the horn section grew 
                    an added responsibility was the writing, arranging, transcribing, and general maintenance of Jac's horn books. After 3 years together Jac's band folded in 2006.
                    For the next two years Evan continued to record on tracks for various bands, backup high school show choirs, and teach private lessons to students of all ages. In 2008 
                    a friend and fellow musician, Ruben Salinas, brought Evan to perform with a band down in Venice called Noble Creatures. With the Noble Creatures Evan began performing 
                    for 
                    live audiences again, this also led him to meet and work with other organizations such as Big Joe Hurt and The Soul Junkies, The Cliff Beach Band, and 
                    The Urban Renewal Project. With Big Joe's and Cliff's organizations Evan once again took up the pen and started writing, arranging, and orchestrating horn parts. 
                    Seeing success The Urban Renewal Project had begun touring the U.S.A. doing shows from Los Angeles to Chicago throughout the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, the South,
                    and the Mid-West. With The Urban Renewal Project, Evan and his band mates even performed at the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia.
                    In 2016 Evan began touring the world with the rock and roll legend and hall of fame inductee Eric Burdon. Getting to perform the legendary music of The Animals with 
                    one of the original members,
                    the legend Eric Burdon, has been a real treat for Evan and the others who began touring with Eric in 2016.

                <h2>Why Bone Man Mack</h2>
                <p>
                    While on stage one of Evan's band leaders would always announce the band. Normally he would call Evan, the big Mack on trombone. This particularly fateful day 
                    some neurons got crossed and
                    the band leader said, "on the bone, man, Mack," After hearing that Evan decided that since all good nick names are given he would accept this one as his own.
